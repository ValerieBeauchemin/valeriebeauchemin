        <p className="About__text">
          In a world bound by the relentless march of time, three extraordinary
          minds dared to dream differently. Dr. Ada Quantum, Professor Leo
          Chronos, and Madeline Tempus are the visionary founders behind
          ChronoSphere, the first company to turn the pages of history and the
          future into destinations. United by their passion for exploration,
          innovation, and the occasional paradox, this trio has rewritten the
          rules of reality.
        </p>
        <p className="About__text">
          Dr. Ada Quantum, with her groundbreaking work in quantum mechanics and
          temporal physics, cracked the code to safe and reliable time travel.
          Her genius lies in creating the ChronoSphere machine, a marvel of
          technology that navigates the complex currents of the time-space
          continuum.
        </p>
        <p className="About__text">
          Professor Leo Chronos, a renowned historian and the moral compass of
          the team, ensures that each tour is not only educational but also
          ethical. His deep understanding of historical events and cultures
          guarantees that ChronoSphere's journeys respect the past while
          celebrating its richness.
        </p>
        <p className="About__text">

          once-in-a-lifetime experiences. Her leadership has catapulted the
          company into the forefront of the adventure tourism industry.
        </p>
        <p className="About__text">
          Together, these founders have created more than just a company;
          they've opened a gateway to the wonders of the universe. At
